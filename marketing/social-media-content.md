# Social Media Content Calendar - VIT Faculty Availability System

## Week 1: Problem Awareness

### Day 1 - LinkedIn Post
```
🎓 Every VIT student knows this struggle...

You need to meet a professor for:
• Project guidance
• Doubt clarification  
• Academic discussion
• Recommendation letters

But when you reach their cabin... they're not there. 😤

Meeting? Emergency? Just stepped out? You have no idea.

So you wait. And wait. And wait.

Sound familiar? 

What if there was a better way? 🤔

### Day 2 - Twitter Thread
```
🧵 The hidden cost of inefficient faculty-student coordination at VIT Vellore:

1/ 30,000 students × 2 faculty visits per week = 60,000 weekly visits

2/ Average unsuccessful visit = 15 minutes wasted

3/ 50% of visits are unsuccessful (faculty not available)

4/ Weekly time wasted = 30,000 × 15 minutes = 450,000 minutes

5/ That's 7,500 HOURS wasted every week! 😱

6/ In a semester (16 weeks) = 120,000 hours of student time wasted

7/ This is just ONE campus. Multiply by 4 VIT campuses...

8/ The problem is MASSIVE. But so is the opportunity to solve it. 💡

What problems do you see in your college that could be solved with technology?
